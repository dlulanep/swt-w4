## 1. Expected Behaviors

1. Products should be filtered correctly based on the selected brand.
Filtered Apple products: [
  { brand: 'Apple', price: 1499, storage: '256GB' },
  { brand: 'Apple', price: 1299, storage: '128GB' }
]
âœ… Test passed: Only Apple products are returned.
2. Products should appear or disappear based on the selected price range.
[
  {
    id: 5,
    brand: 'samsung',
    name: 'Galaxy Z Flip',
    price: 1299,
    storage: 512
  },
  {
    id: 6,
    brand: 'apple',
    name: 'iPhone 14 Pro',
    price: 1499,
    storage: 1024
  }
]
âœ… Test passed: Correct products returned for $1000-$1500.

3. Only products with storage matching the selected value should be displayed.'
[
  {
    id: 2,
    brand: 'samsung',
    name: 'Galaxy S22',
    price: 999,
    storage: 256
  }
]
âœ… Test passed: Only 256GB product is displayed.

## 2. Test Strategy

### Black-Box Testing Techniques

| Technique                | Scope                        | Example/Test Case Description                 |
|--------------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Equivalence Partitioning | Brand, Price, Storage inputs | Test valid/invalid brands, price ranges      |
| Boundary Value Analysis  | Price, Storage               | Test 64GB, 1024GB, min/max price boundaries  |
| Decision Table Testing   | Filter combinations          | Test combinations of brand + price + storage |

# ðŸ§ª Black-Box Test Report: Price Range $1000 - $1500

**Test Case:** Filter products by price range $1000 - $1500  
**Test Type:** Black-Box (Functional, Equivalence Partitioning & Boundary Value Analysis)  
**Date:** 2025-06-14  
**Tested By:** @Pathiswa Dlulane

### White-Box Testing Techniques

| Coverage Type   | Target Function(s)     | Tool/Method | Coverage (%) |
|-----------------|-----------------------|-------------|--------------|
| Statement       | applyFilters()        | Manual      | 100%         |
| Decision        | renderProducts()      | Manual      | 85%          |

## 3. Group Member Contributions

| Member    | Black-Box Techniques Applied          | White-Box Techniques Applied         | Other Contributions                |
|-----------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| @Member1  | Equivalence Partitioning: tested all brand and price ranges | Statement coverage: tested all lines in applyFilters() | Wrote bug report #12               |
| @Member2  | Boundary Value Analysis: tested min/max storage and price | Decision coverage: tested if/else in renderProducts() | Documented test cases, summary     |
| @Member3  | Decision Table: created filter combination matrix | Reviewed code paths and edge cases | Wrote bug report #14, reflections  |

*Each member should briefly describe their specific efforts and the techniques they applied.*

## 4. Defect Log & GitHub Issues

### Linked GitHub Issues

- [#12: Price filter does not display expected products](https://github.com/PLP-Database-DEPT/swt-w4/issues/12)
- [#14: Storage filter requires exact match](https://github.com/PLP-Database-DEPT/swt-w4/issues/14)

### Bug Report 1

**Title**: Price filter does not display expected products

**Steps to Reproduce**:
1. Select price range "1000-1500"
2. Click "Apply Filters"

**Expected**: Should display iPhone 14 Pro ($1499)  
**Actual**: No products displayed  
**Severity**: Medium

---

### Bug Report 2

**Title**: Storage filter requires exact match

**Steps to Reproduce**:
1. Select storage "256GB"
2. Click "Apply Filters"

**Expected**: Should display all products with 256GB storage  
**Actual**: Only displays products if storage is an exact string match  
**Severity**: Low

[
  {
    id: 2,
    brand: 'samsung',
    name: 'Galaxy S22',
    price: 999,
    storage: 256
  }
]
âœ… Test passed: Only 256GB product is displayed.

## 5. Reflection

**Challenges Faced:**  
- Ensuring all edge cases (e.g., minimum/maximum price) were tested.
- Interpreting ambiguous filter behaviors (e.g., overlapping ranges).

**Collaboration Benefits:**  
- Group discussions helped uncover bugs that were missed individually.
-- Hereâ€™s a reflection on testing bugs for your E-Commerce Filter System:

---

Testing revealed several important insights and common pitfalls:

- **Boundary Value Issues:**  
  The price range filter, especially for ranges like "1000-1500", highlighted the importance of handling boundary values correctly. Tests ensured that both $1000 and $1500 were included, catching off-by-one or exclusive/inclusive logic errors.

- **Input Validation:**  
  Storage input validation (64â€“1024 GB) was tested for both valid and invalid values. This surfaced UI feedback bugs and ensured error messages appeared as expected.

- **Black-Box vs. White-Box:**  
  Black-box testing helped confirm that the system behaved correctly from a userâ€™s perspective, regardless of internal implementation. White-box testing ensured all code paths, including edge cases and error handling, were exercised.

- **Test Coverage:**  
  Writing both manual and automated tests increased confidence in the filter logic. Automated tests (e.g., Jest) quickly caught regressions and logic errors.

- **UI Feedback:**  
  Testing also checked that the UI updated correctly (e.g., product count, error messages, no-results message), not just the underlying data.

- Sharing test cases improved overall coverage and efficiency.

**Most Effective Techniques:**  
- Boundary value analysis quickly revealed issues at price/storage limits.
- Decision table testing was useful for complex filter combinations.
